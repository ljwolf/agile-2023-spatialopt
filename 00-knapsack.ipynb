    "[Spatial optimisation](https://doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2012.685044) is the process of solving geographical planning problems using *mathematical programming*. As a starting point, understanding *mathematical programming* is an important step in understanding spatial optimisation methods. Thus, in this workshop, we will start understanding spatial optimisation with a quick tour of an *introductory* mathematical program, the \"Knapsack\" problem. \n",

    "\n",
    "Every mathematical programming problem has three main parts. First, we first represent the specific decisions we have to make about what site to pick for a fire station or what land use to choose for a parcel of land. These are represented by *decision variables*, and they reflect the things that we can change in order to bring about our desired result. Second, another set of equations, the *constraints*, are used to express the requirements that our decision variables must have in our ideal solution. A solution is called *feasible* when it satisfies all of the *constraints* in a problem, and is *infeasible* when one or more constraints is violated by a proposed solution. Third, we have to specify an *objective function*, which is a calculation that depends on the decision variables which measures how \"good\" a solution is.  A feasible solution can be an *optimal solution* when the solution's *objective value* is the highest it can be while obeying the problem constraints. Thus, the goal of mathematical programming is find the best *decision variable* values that maximise the *objective function* while obeying all *constraints*. The role of a *solution technique* is to take the information contained in the constraints and objective function and generate feasible (hopefully optimal) solutions. This workshop will focus *less* on the specifics of solution techniques in order to focus *more* on how to represent problems in spatial optimisation models. \n",

    "### The Knapsack Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The knapsack problem is a very simple mathematical programming problem that is designed to mimick planning for packing to go on a trip: we would like to make sure that we *pack our backpack in a way that maximizes the benefit of items we bring.*  In our case, we have $i = 1, 2, ..., n$ items, and we are trying to decide which of the $n$ to bring to school today. This *decision variable*, $x_i$, will be used to represent whether we bring an item or not. Thus, it can either take a value of $0$ if we bring the item or $1$ if we do not. Each item has some benefit $b_i$ to us throughout the school day, so our *objective function* is the sum of the benefits for items we bring. Mathematically, we can represent this as the sum of the benefit value times the decision variable for each item: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b_1 * x_1 + b_2 * x_2 + ... + b_n * x_n = \\sum_i^n b_ix_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we do not take an item ($x=0$), we derive no benefit. But, when we *do* take an item ($x=1$), it contributes $b_i$ benefit. This is the *objective function*, since it measures how much benefit we get from our decisions $x$. We would like to *maximize* this, because we intend to maximize the benefit we get from the items we take. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we were just able to take all of our items, we would not have a decision problem! Indeed, knapsacks have *limited size*, and we can only fit so many items before it is full. We want to make sure that we only take items that will fit into our knapsack: we want to place a *constraint on the total size of things we take*. To do this, we can imagine that items have a *size*, $s_i$ and the total size of our load is $\\sum_i^n s_i*x_i$ (like our benefit equation above). If we want to make sure that the total size of our load is *smaller than* some knapsack size $c$, we specify the following *size constraint*: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_i^n s_i x_i \\leq c $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we have just outlined the following *mathematical program*:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\" role=\"alert\">\n",
    "<b>The Knapsack Problem </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Maximize:* \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_i^n b_ix_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Subject To:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Size constraint:*&emsp; $\\sum_i^n s_i x_i \\leq c$\n",
    "2. *Binary decisions:*&emsp; $x_i \\in {0,1} \\ \\ \\forall \\ \\ i = 1, 2, ..., n$\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we have one size constraint as outlined above, and we have *n* decision variables that are constrained to be either zero or one. Thus, we have $n+1$ constraints in total: the number of decision variables is often added to the number of constraints, because the conditions we place on the decision are themselves ways that the values of the problem must be constrained. \n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this problem can be done in a few ways. We will not cover specific solution techniques here, as problems quickly get too complicated to solve using methods that are appropriate for *this* problem. Instead, we will now pivot to *showing* you how to set up and solve the knapsack problem in Python. "
